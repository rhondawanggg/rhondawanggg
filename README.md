I’m a data science enthusiast with a huge passion for using Python to dig up cool insights and tackle real-world problems. Whether I’m analyzing massive datasets or building predictive models, I love diving deep into patterns and finding ways to make things work more efficiently. From exploring crime trends in cities to uncovering music preferences, I’m always on the lookout for new and exciting data science projects where I can make a difference ✨！

Right now, I’m leveling up in machine learning and predictive analytics, focusing on using these skills to make smarter decisions and develop better strategies. Let’s collaborate 💌 !

## 🌟 Featured Projects：
- 📊 Criminal Analysis of Boston & Los Angeles: Led a comprehensive analysis of crime trends from 2020-2024, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urban safety. Applied geospatial visualization and linear regression to explore relationships between crime rates and socio-economic factors, offering valuable insights for public safety strategies.

- 🎵 Quantitative Analysis of Spotify’s Top 50 Tracks: Utilized Python and Pandas to uncover trends in Spotify’s top 50 tracks, analyzing song attributes like danceability and genre in relation to their popularity. This project provided key insights into how users engage with music on a global scale.

- 🌐 VitalPath (**HackHarvard 2024**): Developed a website to deliver real-time health insights by collecting self-reported data and using AI to predict potential health conditions. Collaborated with a team to build a machine learning model, focusing on diseases like diabetes and hypertension, and connected users to remote healthcare resources for timely medical attention.
